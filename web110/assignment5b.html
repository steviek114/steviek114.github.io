<h1>Lesson Summary: Communications</h1>
<p>In the second half of Lesson 5, we learned about communication services over the internet, including Voice over IP, file transfer, file sharing, and screen sharing. These technologies allow us to share media and communicate in real time across the internet.</p>
<h2>Activity 1: Screen Sharing / Remote Desktop</h2>
<p>The first activity I chose was to research remote desktop applications. The application I chose was Chrome Remote Desktop. This application allows users to remotely control another computer through a proprietary protocol. I’ve used remote desktop applications before to play video games when I’m out of the house but never for any work purposes. I accessed chrome on my laptop from my desktop and emailed a file to myself. I think moving forward I'm going to use applications like this to access some of my files remotely.</p>
<h3>Activity 2: VoIP / Messaging</h3>
<p>The second activity I chose was to explore VoIP applications. The one I chose was skype. I already have a skype so the tutorial wasn't that informative, but I used to use skype a lot when I was younger to communicate with my friends while playing games. Now we use discord, but it was interesting to go back and explore some of the user interfaces that I haven't used in a long time. I don’t think I’ll be using skype moving forward because it has been replaced by better applications like discord or zoom.</p>
