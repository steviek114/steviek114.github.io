<h1>Lesson Summary: Final Project</h1>
<p>For my final project, I chose to do a presentation on CSS. I think CSS coding is very important to understanding how websites work. HTML code focuses on the functionality of websites, but most of the time, users of the web will never see the HTML code. That’s why understanding CSS is so important—it’s the look and feel of the entire internet. HTML code does all the work under the hood, but CSS is the paint job. I was unaware of how CSS first came about when researching my project. I found it very interesting that style sheets had been around since the 1980s, but it wasn't until the early 1990s that the idea of cascading style sheets was introduced. CSS allowed a document's style to be influenced by multiple style sheets. One style sheet could inherit or "cascade" from another. CSS doesn't just relate to web design; it is web design! CSS is the reason why websites look different from one another.</p>
