<h1>Lesson Summary: Email</h1>
<p>Email is an electronic method of exchanging messages, operating on a store-and-forward model where mail servers accept, deliver, and store messages. It supports multimedia attachments, and emails contain headers like Date, From, To, Subject, Cc, and Bcc. Messages are transferred via mail transfer agents and delivered by mail delivery agents, with undelivered messages resulting in bounce notifications. Users access emails through mail user agents or web-based platforms. Internet messaging protocol allows mailbox management across multiple devices, while post office protocol often deletes messages from the server after retrieval. Electronic mailing lists distribute messages to multiple subscribers via automated software, either individually or in daily digests.</p>
<p>A significant vulnerability of emails, however, is the danger of phishing. Phishing is a cyberattack where scammers impersonate trusted entities to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial details, usually through fraudulent emails. These emails may seem innocent, like “a message from a friend” that contains an attachment with a virus. Phishing can also be more sophisticated, where the attacker disguises themselves as someone in need of assistance, asking simple questions that dupe the user into revealing sensitive data.
