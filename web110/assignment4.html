<h1>Lesson Summary: Email</h1>
<p>Email is an electronic method of exchanging messages, operating on a store-and-forward model where mail servers accept, deliver, and store messages. It supports multimedia attachments, and emails contain headers like Date, From, To, Subject, Cc, and Bcc. Messages are transferred via mail transfer agents and delivered by mail delivery agents, with undelivered messages resulting in bounce notifications. Users access emails through mail user agents or web-based platforms. Internet messaging protocol allows mailbox management across multiple devices, while post office protocol often deletes messages from the server after retrieval. Electronic mailing lists distribute messages to multiple subscribers via automated software, either individually or in daily digests.</p>
<p>A significant vulnerability of emails, however, is the danger of phishing. Phishing is a cyberattack where scammers impersonate trusted entities to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial details, usually through fraudulent emails. These emails may seem innocent, like “a message from a friend” that contains an attachment with a virus. Phishing can also be more sophisticated, where the attacker disguises themselves as someone in need of assistance, asking simple questions that dupe the user into revealing sensitive data.

<h2>Activity 1: Send, Receive, and Respond to Email</h2>
<p>The first activity I chose was to send, receive, and respond to an email. I already had an email, so the tutorial was pretty simple and easy to follow. I decided to email a friend a copy of an MP4 file of a current video project I’m working on. One thing I learned was the signature feature of Gmail. I was unaware of this feature and think it's pretty neat. However, I question whether or not Gmail is secure enough for me to feel comfortable having my signature stored on a server somewhere. I already use email quite frequently, so it won’t be that much of a significant change to integrate it into my current work routine. However, I think I will make use of the organizing features Gmail provides to organize my inbox better.</p>
<h3>Activity 2: Use Internet Mailing Lists</h3>
<p>The second activity I chose was to research mailing lists and bulk email restrictions. I am already a part of several mailing lists, mostly for certain Reddit communities I find interesting, like PC building or at-home server maintenance. I didn't know that there were bulk email restrictions, but upon further reading, I'm very glad there are. One of the most famous is the CAN-SPAM Act. This law in the United States requires mailing lists to have a clear way to opt out. My inbox is full of junk as is; it would be a nightmare if there wasn’t a clear way to opt out. I think in the future I might use mailing lists to gain views on some of my video projects. I’ll probably use a service like Mailchimp to make sure I’m following all the correct restrictions.</p>
