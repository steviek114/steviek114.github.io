<h1>Assignment 15a: Javascript and IT careers</h1>
<p>The activity I chose for session 15 was to create a resume and LinkedIn profile. I already have a resume and a LinkedIn profile, but this was a great opportunity to revise and update them. LinkedIn won't just be something I'll have to incorporate into my career-searching tools because it basically IS the career-searching tool for corporate technology jobs. Something I found interesting was the "job experience catch-22," which happens when a job listing asks for experience in a certain field but is labeled as entry-level. I learned that sharing similar experiences in your cover letter can help get around this</p>
