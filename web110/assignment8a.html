<h1>Lesson Summary: Unordered Lists</h1>
<p>For assignment 8a, I created an ordered list of my assignments inside my Web 110 repository. I created this list by using ul tags to create the list, then li tags for the list items. Once I created the list, I populated it with a href="" tags to create links to my other assignments in my repository.</p>
<p>This is not the first time I have created lists on my web pages, as I have had to create them for other assignments in other classes. However, the assignment was a good reminder of the structure of the HTML code used to create an unordered list.</p>
<p>If I were developing some sort of database or wiki, unordered lists with links directing the user to other pages would be quite helpful in organizing the website and keeping information easy to access. Another way I could use a href="" tags would be to direct my clients to other pages while the current site was under construction.</p>
