<h1>Lesson Summary: Networking</h1>
<p>Session 6 discusses computer networks. A network is a system that allows the exchange of data through packets over wired or wireless connections, like Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Some key devices include routers and modems. Networks are characterized by their size and function. For example, LAN, which is a Local Area Network. Another network is a Virtual Private Network (VPN); these kinds of networks allow a private connection over a public network. VPNs can provide an added layer of security when browsing public networks.</p>
<h2>Activity 1: Review Ping/Host</h2>
<p>For my first activity, I chose to review Ping/Host and verify local and remote connectivity using ping. I did this by running a command prompt on my computer. I was completely unaware that I could use this as a method of checking whether or not my device was communicating with my local network. Then, I pinged 8.8.8.8, which came back fine. I didn’t know I could also use this to diagnose connectivity issues. I’m not quite sure how I might incorporate this into my current workflow, but I could see it being helpful if I were developing a project where I needed to check the connectivity of a server or something along those lines.

<h3>Activity 2: Research and compare license and support costs for Windows, macOS, and Linux</h3>
<p>The second activity I chose was to research and compare license and support costs for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Windows has an upfront license cost and affordable business support. Linux is free and open-source, which means there are plenty of free resources online for support. However, if the Linux distribution is more niche, it might be harder to find support for it. macOS is free but requires Apple hardware to run, and it has very pricey support costs.</p>
<p>I already use Windows and Linux, so I didn’t learn much about them that I didn’t already know, but I didn’t know that macOS is free. Given how expensive Apple products are, I thought the operating system would also cost money. Moving forward, I think I’m going to use Windows in a more professional setting since it is very universal and support is easy to find. However, for personal projects, I might use Linux because of its open-source capabilities.</p>
