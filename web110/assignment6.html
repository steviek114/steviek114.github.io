<h1>Lesson Summary: Networking</h1>
<p>Session 6 discusses computer networks. A network is a system that allows the exchange of data through packets over wired or wireless connections, like Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Some key devices include routers and modems. Networks are characterized by their size and function. For example, LAN, which is a Local Area Network. Another network is a Virtual Private Network (VPN); these kinds of networks allow a private connection over a public network. VPNs can provide an added layer of security when browsing public networks.</p>
