<h1>Brave: A better privacy option</h1>
<p>The two activities I chose for this assignment were to download different web browsers and compare them. The two browsers I selected were Chrome and Brave. Brave is a free and open-source web browser focused on privacy, security, and speed. It was developed by Brave Software, a company founded by Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and co-founder of Mozilla. Brave is powered by Chromium, the same engine that powers Chrome and other browsers. Where Brave differs is in its emphasis on user privacy and data protection. For example, Brave has a built-in third-party ad blocker and blocks cross-site trackers by default.
  Cross-site trackers are scripts or technologies used by websites to track your activity across multiple websites, often through third-party cookies. Cookies store data about your interactions with websites. While I knew cross-site tracking was common online, I didn’t realize that simply disabling cookies might not be enough to stop trackers. Using Brave as a browser eliminates the need to manually disable tracking and cookies, as it does this automatically. The privacy benefits of Brave would be especially useful if I were working in an environment where I was concerned about my data being used without my consent.

<h2>Chrome: The most commonly used web browser</h2>
<p>The second browser I selected was Google Chrome, one of the most commonly used web browsers in the world. Chrome is known for its speed, simplicity, and extensive range of features. Developed by Google, Chrome is powered by the Chromium engine, which enables fast webpage loading and smooth performance. One of Chrome's key benefits is its integration with the Google ecosystem, making it an excellent choice for users who rely on services like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Docs. With a Google account, Chrome can sync bookmarks, browsing history, passwords, and even open tabs across devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.
  Another significant advantage of Chrome is its extensive library of extensions available through the Chrome Web Store. These extensions allow users to customize their browsing experience, whether for productivity, entertainment, or privacy. Chrome also provides regular updates to improve security and performance, offering features like Safe Browsing to warn users about dangerous websites. Moving forward, I think it's important to pay attention not only to the browser I use but also to how my data is being handled by it. If a project I’m tasked with requires a high level of security, Chrome might not be secure enough for the type of work I’m doing. Additionally, since Chrome uses significant system resources, I might choose a lighter browser for projects requiring more machine power.
