    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>In Assignment 11, I used the Northwind database to answer a set of 15 questions. The questions ranged from identifying the items within different tables to calculating the extended cost of certain products. I had no prior experience working with databases like this, and, in all honesty, it was quite confusing. One thing that frustrated me was that I could not sort two columns at the same time, which made searching through the database very difficult. However, I learned how to compare ID numbers of certain entries to their corresponding entries in other tables. I ended up using the Ctrl + F tool on the PC to find exact data entries. Overall, I have gained a lot of knowledge about how databases look and operate. In the future, if I have to use a database, I hope it has helpful organizational features like sorting or filtering.</p>
