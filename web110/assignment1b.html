    <title>Assignment 1b: Managing Files and Folders</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Topic: Files and Folders</h1>
    <p>For this assignment I chose Managing files and Folders. Managing files and folders is key to keeping an organized workspace and keeping track of all necessary files. There are many different types of files. For example there are mp3 files for audio or jpeg for images. However the first step to accessing our files is to locate the file explorer application on the computer. Most operating systems offer an application that allows you to access the files, sometimes named “file explorer” or just “files.” Files are stored in folders which help keep them organized. It is helpful to organize files based on their format or content.</p>
 <h2>What I Learned From This Topic</h2>
    <p>Most of the information in this activity is information I am already familiar with. I spend a lot of time on my personal computer, so I am very accustomed to moving around files and folders. However, I did learn that functions performed using key shortcuts like copy and paste, can be undone with the control z shortcut. I also learned that I can use the control key to select multiple items in the file explorer without needing to highlight all of the items. Another important bit of information I learned was that placing items in the recycling bin does not fully delete them. Having files remain in the recycle bin still takes up storage.
