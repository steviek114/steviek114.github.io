<h1>Lesson Summary: Security</h1>
<p>In Lesson 7, we learned about Internet Security. Internet security is a type of computer security that revolves around protecting users from online threats like malware, phishing, and unauthorized access. The Internet hosts many vulnerabilities that allow threats like viruses, worms, Trojans, and other malicious software to steal data or damage systems. Some common protections against these threats are firewalls, antivirus software, and two-factor authentication.</p>
<h2>Activity 1: Clearing the Browser Cache</h2>
<p>My first activity was to clear my browser cache. I did this by navigating to the Chrome setting called “More tools” and selecting Clear browsing data. From there, I selected the date and time, choosing the last 24 hours, then clicked Clear data. I knew about clearing my cache, as I’ve had to do it before to make sure certain video games run well. However, I noticed that after clearing it, the websites I was using loaded faster. I think in the future, I’ll clear my cache before I begin work on any projects to make sure things are running as smoothly as possible.</p>
<h3>Activity 2: Use Incognito Browsing</h3>
<p>The second activity I chose was to access a website using incognito mode. I use incognito often when visiting online shopping sites so that I am not tracked across sites. The inconvenience of these sites not remembering my preferences is a little annoying. I think for a more corporate or workplace setting, if a project requires security, I’ll use incognito on the local network to protect my internet traffic better.</p>
