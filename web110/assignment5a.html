<h1>Lesson Summary: Social Media</h1>
<p>In the first half of Session 5, we learned about social media. Social media are platforms that allow for the creation and sharing of information, ideas, interests, and other forms of expression via virtual communities and forums. Features include user-generated content, interactive web applications, and profile-based connectivity. They offer benefits such as reputation building, career opportunities, and marketing potential for businesses and organizations. However, concerns include privacy risks, cyberbullying, and mental health effects.</p>
<h2>Activity 1: Snapchat</h2>
<p>The first activity I chose was to review GCF’s tutorial on Snapchat. Snapchat is a social media platform predominantly used to exchange photos and videos among friends, as well as offering a place to post updates that can be viewed by the public. Snapchat offers its users the unique feature of disappearing photos and videos. Photos and videos sent through Snapchat can only be viewed a certain number of times before they are deleted. Snapchat is most popular among teens and young adults.
  I already have a Snapchat account, so the tutorial wasn’t that informative. However, something I found interesting while researching Snapchat is some of the controversies surrounding the feature of disappearing content. The content is no longer viewable or accessible by users but still remains on Snapchat’s internal servers. Some people view this as a privacy concern, given that some users are unaware that the content is saved elsewhere.
  I haven't used Snapchat as much since I graduated high school, so I don’t think I’ll be incorporating it into any of my current projects. However, I will still keep my account activated so I can use it as a networking opportunity</p>
