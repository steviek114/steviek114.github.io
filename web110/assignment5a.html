<h1>Lesson Summary: Social Media</h1>
<p>In the first half of Session 5, we learned about social media. Social media are platforms that allow for the creation and sharing of information, ideas, interests, and other forms of expression via virtual communities and forums. Features include user-generated content, interactive web applications, and profile-based connectivity. They offer benefits such as reputation building, career opportunities, and marketing potential for businesses and organizations. However, concerns include privacy risks, cyberbullying, and mental health effects.</p>
