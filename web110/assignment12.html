<h2>Assignment 12: Summary Paragraph</h2>
<p>In Assignment 12, I learned about SQL. SQL is a standard programming language used to manage databases. Before completing this assignment, I assumed that if someone wanted to add or change things in a database, they could add it directly to the database. I was unaware there was a whole coding language just for databases. The process wasn't as visually appealing as I would have thought. However, if needed, I now know some of the language used to search inside databases or add entries. I can see this being a useful skill if one of my clients wants their website to access a database.</p>
