<h1>Lesson Summary: Accessibility</h1>
<p>Session 8 covered the topic of web accessibility. Web accessibility ensures that users with disabilities or limitations of any kind can access and interact with content on websites. Web accessibility addresses this through assistive technologies like screen readers, braille terminals, magnification software, keyboard overlays, and captions. The W3C has established guidelines, including WCAG, ATAG, and UAAG, to improve accessibility. Adhering to these guidelines is legally binding in regions like North America, Europe, parts of South America, and parts of Asia.</p>
<h2>Activity 1: Use the Paletton</h2>
<p>The first activity I chose was to use Paletton. Paletton is an online color scheme designer tool that helps users create visually appealing and harmonious color palettes. I used the triad color tool, which generated two additional colors to the one I selected. The triad tool was helpful for me when creating a color scheme for an upcoming redesign of my room. I think when I’m creating CSS code, I’ll use Paletton to help keep the colors I’m using harmonious.</p>
<h3>Activity 2: Use the WebAIM Contrast Checker</h3>
<p>The second activity I chose was to use the WebAIM Contrast Checker, an online tool that helps users evaluate the color contrast between text and background elements to ensure readability and accessibility. It follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). I found it interesting how certain colors and backgrounds I thought looked nice didn't pass the guidelines. Moving forward, when designing websites, I’ll use the contrast checker to ensure I’m following all the proper guidelines.</p>
