<h1>Lesson Summary: Mulitmedia</h1>
<p>In this lesson, I learned about adding multimedia inside a webpage. Some multimedia could be images, videos, or audio. Initially, the process of adding the audio and image files was not hard. I decided to create a separate folder for my audio to keep things organized. The main struggle arose when I decided to style the media with CSS. I had to convert both the image and audio media to display as blocks and then center them from there. I think multimedia is key to modern webpages, and I don’t think I’ll ever work on a project, at the professional level, that doesn’t deal with it. I think sharpening my CSS skills so that I don’t have to do so much troubleshooting will save me lots of time on more complex projects.</p>
