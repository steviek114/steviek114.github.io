<h1>Lesson Summary: Search Engines</h1>
<p>A web search engine is software that searches the internet, using web crawlers to gather and index data. It refines results with search operators and Boolean logic, prioritizing relevance. Most search engines generate revenue through ads, with some allowing paid rankings. Popular search engines like Google and Bing offer personalized results based on user activity. Webmasters can submit sites for indexing, while SEO improves visibility in unpaid results. AI, a branch of computer science, enables machines to learn and work like humans.</p>
<h2>Activity 1: Compare Search Engines</h2>

<h3>Activity 2: Use the Internet Archive</h3>
<p>The second activity I chose was to use the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. The Wayback Machine is a tool used to access archived websites. Users type in a URL, select a date range, and then begin surfing an archived version of the web. There are many different reasons why someone would want to access a website that has been archived in the past. For example, some websites host content like videos or music. If the owner of that site decides to remove a feature or piece of content, they can, and without a tool like the Wayback Machine, that content could be lost forever. Another use could be for fact-checking purposes. News stories change over time, and news organizations sometimes retract certain information. With the Wayback Machine, a user can see the original article before any retractions or changes. I didn't realize the amount of webpages that were archived, and I learned about the concept of preserving media and webpages. The tool is quite intuitive, and I learned how to archive a webpage. I have used the Wayback Machine to download fan-made video game projects that were shut down by larger game studios on grounds of intellectual property (IP) infringement. Without the Wayback Machine, those games might be lost to time. I think the Wayback Machine is very important to data preservation. I plan on incorporating this into my current work ethic when it comes to my online projects. I plan on archiving the webpages I work on as well as the ones I use for resources, like tutorials or how-to guides.
