<h1>Lesson Summary: Search Engines</h1>
<p>A web search engine is software that searches the internet, using web crawlers to gather and index data. It refines results with search operators and Boolean logic, prioritizing relevance. Most search engines generate revenue through ads, with some allowing paid rankings. Popular search engines like Google and Bing offer personalized results based on user activity. Webmasters can submit sites for indexing, while SEO improves visibility in unpaid results. AI, a branch of computer science, enables machines to learn and work like humans.</p>
