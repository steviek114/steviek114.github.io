<h1>Lesson Summary: Search Engines</h1>
<p>A web search engine is software that searches the internet, using web crawlers to gather and index data. It refines results with search operators and Boolean logic, prioritizing relevance. Most search engines generate revenue through ads, with some allowing paid rankings. Popular search engines like Google and Bing offer personalized results based on user activity. Webmasters can submit sites for indexing, while SEO improves visibility in unpaid results. AI, a branch of computer science, enables machines to learn and work like humans.</p>
<h2>Activity 1: Compare Search Engines</h2>
<p>The first activity I chose was to compare search engines. I searched "web search engine" in three different search engines: Chrome, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask. Google was, as expected, very minimalist and had very little clutter. Bing and Yahoo, on the other hand, felt very slow, and there was a lot of clutter—lots of images and websites that didn't really pertain to what I was searching for. Another thing Yahoo did was open a new tab instead of just showing me the results on the original tab, which I really didn't like. Honestly, I had never even heard of Ask; it felt kind of outdated. It didn't have an images tab like Google, but it was similarly minimalistic. The search results were more or less accurate. Something I picked up on rather quickly was that lots of clutter, like images and hyperlinks, made it harder for me to find the information I was looking for. Moving forward, when I am designing websites, I will keep in mind the ‘vibe’ of the website. I’ll try to keep clutter to a minimum and keep the design coherent. However, I recognize that some people may prefer clutter, so I’ll have to keep my clients' wishes in mind when designing for them.</p>
<h3>Activity 2: Use the Internet Archive</h3>
<p>The second activity I chose was to use the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. The Wayback Machine is a tool used to access archived websites. Users type in a URL, select a date range, and then begin surfing an archived version of the web. There are many different reasons why someone would want to access a website that has been archived in the past. For example, some websites host content like videos or music. If the owner of that site decides to remove a feature or piece of content, they can, and without a tool like the Wayback Machine, that content could be lost forever. Another use could be for fact-checking purposes. News stories change over time, and news organizations sometimes retract certain information. With the Wayback Machine, a user can see the original article before any retractions or changes. I didn't realize the amount of webpages that were archived, and I learned about the concept of preserving media and webpages. The tool is quite intuitive, and I learned how to archive a webpage. I have used the Wayback Machine to download fan-made video game projects that were shut down by larger game studios on grounds of intellectual property (IP) infringement. Without the Wayback Machine, those games might be lost to time. I think the Wayback Machine is very important to data preservation. I plan on incorporating this into my current work ethic when it comes to my online projects. I plan on archiving the webpages I work on as well as the ones I use for resources, like tutorials or how-to guides.
